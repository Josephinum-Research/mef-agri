class Model(object):
    """
    Base class for all models which should be evaluated for computing crop 
    growth. 
    Each model which should be evaluated and connected with other models has to 
    inherit from this class. 

    Only the root/top-level model has to be initialized "manually".
    In this case, only the ``model_name`` of the model has to be provided as 
    keyword argument.
    All child models in the model-tree (added with :func:`is_child_model`) are 
    initialized and added to the model-tree automatically in the initialization 
    of the root/top-level model.
    The ``model_name`` of child models equals the name of the decorated method.

    The conversion of decorated methods (quantity, child model or requirement) 
    into attributes happens at the time of model initialization.
    
    Quantities
    ----------
    
    There are five main types of quantities (summarized in 
    :class:`__QS__`).
    In order to add such quantities as attributes to a model, one can use 
    the decorator :func:`is_quantity`, provided as static method in this class.
    Methods, with this decorator are automatically accessable from outside 
    of the model as attributes (similar to the python built-in ``property``
    decorator). 

    Child Models
    ------------

    Child models are added as methods decorated with :func:`is_child_model`. 
    In the decorator, the model-tree will be extended (see 
    :class:`mef_agri.models.tree.ModelTree`) and the child model is implemented 
    as an attribute.

    Requirements
    ------------

    Requirements are quantities contained in other models of the model-tree 
    which are necessary in the computations of the current model.
    The advantage of using :class:`mef_agri.models.requ.Requirement` is, that 
    unit conversions are automatically applied.
    Required quantities from child models could be also directly accessed via 
    the corresponding attributes.
    But in these cases unit conversions have to be done manually.
    Another option to access required quantities from other models is, to use 
    the :func:`model_tree` property of this class.

    kwargs
    ------

    * **model_name** (*str*) - has to be provided in the initialization of the root/top-level model, otherwise it is automatically passed in the :func:`is_child_model` decorator
    * **model_id** (*str*) - is automatically passed in the :func:`is_child_model` decorator, when a child model is initialized
    * **model_tree** (:class:`mef_agri.models.tree.ModelTree`) - is automatically passed in the :func:`is_child_model` decorator, when a child model is initialized
